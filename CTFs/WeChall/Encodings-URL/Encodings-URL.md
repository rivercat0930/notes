# Encodings-URL

URL Encoding is a method to encode arbitrary data in a uniform resource identifier (URI) using only the US-ASCII characters legal within a URI.

Although it is known as URL encoding, it is also used more generally within the main Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) set, which includes both Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and Uniform Resource Name (URN).
