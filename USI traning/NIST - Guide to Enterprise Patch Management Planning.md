# NIST Special Publication - Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning:Preventive Maintenance for Technology

## Executive Summary

*Enterprise patch management* is the process of identifying, prioritizing, acquiring, installing and verifying the installation of patches, updates, and upgrades throughout an organization.

In past perimeter-based security architectures, most software was operated on internal networks protected by several layers of network security controls.
While patching was generally considered important for reducing the likelihood of compromise and was a common compliance requirement, **patching was not always considered a priority.**

**In today's environments, patching has become more important, often rising to the level of mission criticality.**

As a part of a zero trust approach to security, it is now recognized that the perimeter largely does not exist anymore, and most technologies are directly exposed to the internet, putting systems at significantly greater risk of compromise.

There is often a divide between business/mission owners and security/technology management.
***Leadership and business/mission owners should reconsider the priority of enterprise patch management in light of today's risks.***
**Patching should be considered a standard cost of doing business and should be rigorously followed and tracked.**

## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this publication is to ***help organizations imporove their enterprise patch management planning*** so that they can strengthen their management of risk.

This publication is intended to apply to all types of computing technology assets, including IT, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, and cloud computing, and to all types of patchable software, including applications, operating systems, and firmware.

[**Additional Information**]

* IT includes desktop and laptop computers, on-premises servers, networking equipment, printers, and other types of assets typically found in an organization's own offices or data centers.

* OT refers to programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment)

## Risk Response Approaches for Software Vulnerabilities

This section outlines possible risk response approaches for software vulnerabilities, provides an overview of the software vulnerability management life cycle, and takes a closer look at parts of that life cycle with respect to patching.

### Risk Responses

Patching is one of several ways to respond to risks from software vulnerabilities.

This publication references four types of *risk responses*

1. **Accept**

    Accept the risk from vulnerable software as is, such as by relying on existing security controls to prevent vulnerability exploitation or by determining that the potential impact is low enough that no additional action is needed.

    [**Additional Information**]

    * What is security controls?

        Security controls are parameters implemented to protect various forms of data and infrastructure important to an organization.

        Security controls refers to any type of safeguard or countermeasure used to avoid, detect, counteract or minimize security risks to physical property, information, computer systems or other assets.

        * Physical security controls

            Such things as data center perimeter fencing, locks, guards, access control cards, biometric access control systems, surveillance cameras and instrusion detection sensors.

        * Digital security controls

        * Cybersecurity controls

        * Cloud security controls

    * Waht is potential impact is low enough?

1. **Mitigate**

    Reduce the risk by eliminating the vulnerabilities (patching the vulnerable software, disabling a vulnerable feature, or upgrading to a newer software version without the vulnerabilities) and/or deploying additional security controls to reduce vulnerability exploitation (...)
